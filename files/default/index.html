<h1>Ideals</h1>

<p>Vote Squared is a platform for voters to rate politicians.  Vote Squared holds politicians accountable for their campaign promises by having voters submit those promises and have voters rate the politician's performance to meet those promises.  With Vote Squared, voters will be able to see what their peers say rather than only seeing what the politicians pay to air and what the media chooses to air.<p>

<p>Media mega-corporations have a huge stake in who gets elected.  They choose what to air while keeping in mind their interests.  A politician that is for a policy that will hurt them or their subsidiary will get poor coverage.  For example, ABC is owned by Disney.  Disney wants to prevent Mickey Mouse from going out of copyright.  ABC thus has it in their best interest to support politicians who will extend the length of a copyright to keep Mickey Mouse protected from being part of the public domain.</p>

<p>The Democratic and Republican parties monopolize attention by locking out third party candidates from ballots and from debates.  Media mega-corporations like the status quo, and do not want to risk the lesser known politics of independent and third-party candidates.  Vote Squared will show all candidates regardless of party.  In fact, Vote Squared will make every effort to limit view of the politician's party to prevent party from biasing voters.  The difference between the Repblican and Democratic parties are only surface deep.  They are a camouflage to make the parties appear different.  In fact, there is very little of importance that members of opposing parties act differently on.  As an example, Obama kept Bush's time-table for Iraq and kept the US in Afghanistan for most of his presidency.  Obama also strengthened the Patriot act that Bush helped to create.  Despite promises to the contrary, Obama has kept Guantanamo Bay open.</p>

<p>The majority of campaign funds come from a limited number of voters.  Reciprocity subconsciously motivates politicians to help their supporters over their voters.  This site will show how all voters feel, not just the ones who have money to spare for political advertising.</p>

<h1>Community</h1>

<p>Vote Squared was founded by Forest Handford.  As Forest has always lived in the US, his focus is on US politicians.  We welcome help from the international community to broaden Vote Squared's reach.  Every country with some form of democracy is welcome to have content here.  While we may not understand your country's needs, we are open to helping you contribute to Vote Squared to meet those needs.</p>

<p>The software behind Vote Squared is open source.  You may contribute to the code via <a href="https://github.com/ForestJay/VoteSquaredHomePage">pull requests on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>As a social platform, users are encouraged to add content to the site.  This content can include adding politicians, updating politician information, and rating politicians.</p>

<h1>Funding</h1>

<p>All of the costs for Vote Squared are currently being paid for by Forest Handford.  As the site (and costs) grow, we will look for additional funds.  We would like to get some early funds from KickStarter.  Overtime, we would like to collect donations from users to cover the costs.</p>
